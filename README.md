# OpenGL Realtime Renderer

For the final project in CSE 168, I created a real-time renderer in OpenGL using GLSL programmable shaders. The renderer is able to load in objects and display them with diffuse, specular, normal, and roughness maps using a Cook-Tolerance BRDF to calculate lighting. The renderer can also calculate shadows for multiple point lights in a scene. Finally, skyboxes can be added as well and environmentally mapped to reflective objects in the scene.

For the base renderer, I used GLFW and GLAD for access to OpenGL function calls and the ability to easily create a window. I also used GLM for all math operations. I first created a set of classes to have vertex buffer, index buffer, and shader creation to abstract out many of the numerous OpenGL function calls. I then created a mesh class to contain these and a model class to handle object transformations. After drawing basic shapes to the screen, I then moved on to adding texture support. For image loading, I used the stb_image library which could load both standard image files as well as HDR images. Finally, to load in more complex models I used the Assimp library. I created a series of functions to parse the vertex data given by it, but I was unable to get texture files so I ended up handling this manually on a case-by-case basis for each model.

Next, I began working on shadow and environmental maps. For the shadows, I implemented shadow maps for point lights by saving depth values from the light's perspective to a cube map and then comparing these to the depth values from the camera's perspective during the final rendering. For antialiasing the final shadow, I implemented percentage closer filtering. To increase performance, I created an array of predefined offsets to reduce the number of samples being taken. For environmental maps, I first used a simple shader to convert the two-dimensional hdr images into a cube map. This cube map was then sent to the final model rending shaders and a reflection vector was used to look up its data.

Up to this point, I had been using the basic Phong lighting model to light up each scene. It was at this time that I began to implement a cook-tolerance BRDF to handle direct lighting. During this same time, I changed the shaders so that all rendering was done using the texture maps. The diffuse, specular, and roughness of an object were all determined by their respective texture maps. I also added in normal map support which altered vertex normals slightly for each fragment to increase the detail on models when they were lighted or reflecting an environment map.
